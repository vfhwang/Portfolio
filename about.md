Hello, I’m Victor. Right now I’m one of the lead product designers at Farewill, where we’re working to change the way people think about death.

I aim to promote the use of design and research as a better way to understand and tackle complex problems.

Before this I was working at  UK Parliament, and before that the BBC. I’ve also done stints at <a target="_blank" href="https://mettle-studio.com/">Mettle</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://commonindustry.co.uk/">Common Industry</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://sugru.com/">Sugru</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://moderndesignreview.com/">Modern Design Review</a>.
